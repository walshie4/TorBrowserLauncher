#TorBrowserLauncher

###Important
I am in no way affiliated with the TorProject (although I do admire their work), and this script
is in no way endorsed or supported by them. This is meant to serve as a launcher script. I 
completely understand if you don't want to automate this process and feel safer running the 
commands yourself. However if you are a user who would otherwise not verify the signature's
or don't mind out-sourcing this process to an open source script then this is for you.

If you have any issues please report them here or send me an email so I can fix them. Hope this 
script helps!
